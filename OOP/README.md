# OOP

## SOLID

1. Single Responsibility

Anything in your code should have ONE responsibility -> Only have 1 reason to change

2. Open/Closed

open to extension, closed to modification

3. Liskov Substitution

If S is a subtype of T, then object of type T may be replaced with objects of type S

1. Interface Segregation

When you have an interface, you need use every portion of the interface when implementing. It is invalid if an implementation of an interface does not implement all aspects of the interface

5. Dependency Inversion

high-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This helps decouple the high-level and low-level modules, making it easier to change the low-level ones without affecting the high-level ones.
